# audittool changelog

lazymention follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver]. Specifically, the following things are considered to be semver-major if changed in a backwards-incompatible way:

* CLI usage
* Supported Node.js versions
* This list of items

Changes to everything else are not considered breaking. Notably, these are _not_ considered breaking:

* Interactive CLI behavior

If you think something that isn't in the first list should be covered, or aren't sure about something, please feel free to file an issue and I'll clarify the policy - this list could surely be more precise.

## 1.0.0 - future

* Initial release

 [semver]: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
